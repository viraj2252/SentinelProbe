# SentinelProbe UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for SentinelProbe's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

*   **Security Professionals:** Technical users who need a powerful and flexible interface to manage scans, analyze results, and customize the tool to their needs.
*   **DevOps Teams:** Users who need a simple and intuitive interface to integrate security testing into their CI/CD pipeline and quickly identify and fix vulnerabilities.

#### Usability Goals

*   **Ease of Use:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for users who are not security experts.
*   **Efficiency:** The interface should allow users to complete their tasks quickly and efficiently.
*   **Clarity:** The interface should present information in a clear and concise way, making it easy for users to understand the results of their scans.

#### Design Principles

1.  **Clarity over cleverness:** Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation.
2.  **Progressive disclosure:** Show only what's needed, when it's needed.
3.  **Consistent patterns:** Use familiar UI patterns throughout the application.

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:**

*   Dashboard
*   Scans
*   Results
*   Reports
*   Settings

**Secondary Navigation:**

*   **Scans:** New Scan, Scan History
*   **Results:** Vulnerability List, Vulnerability Details
*   **Reports:** Report List, Report Details
*   **Settings:** Profile, System

**Breadcrumb Strategy:**

A breadcrumb navigation will be used to show the user's current location in the application.

## User Flows

### Create and Run a Scan

**User Goal:** To create and run a new scan.

**Entry Points:**

*   "New Scan" button on the Dashboard.
*   "New Scan" button in the Scans section.

**Success Criteria:**

The user is able to create a new scan, run it, and view the results.

**Flow Diagram:**

    A[Start] --> B{New Scan}
    B --> C[Enter Scan Details]
    C --> D{Run Scan}
    D --> E[Scan in Progress]
    E --> F[Scan Complete]
    F --> G[View Results]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

*   Invalid scan parameters.
*   Scan fails to start.
*   Scan is cancelled.

**Notes:**

The user should be able to save a scan configuration as a template to be used for future scans.
