# SentinelProbe Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Establish SentinelProbe as a leading open-source penetration testing tool.
*   Foster an active and engaged community of contributors and users.
*   Achieve 10,000 downloads within the first year.
*   Reduce the time it takes to conduct a penetration test by 50%.
*   Increase the number of vulnerabilities identified by 25%.
*   Improve the accuracy of vulnerability detection, reducing false positives by 30%.

### Background Context

Manual penetration testing is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often fails to keep pace with the rapid development cycles of modern software. Existing solutions are often expensive, proprietary, and lack the flexibility to be customized to specific needs. This creates a significant gap in security for many organizations, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the growing complexity of IT environments further exacerbate this problem, making it difficult for organizations to effectively assess their security posture.

SentinelProbe addresses these challenges by providing an AI-driven, open-source penetration testing platform. The core of the solution is a modular architecture that allows for flexibility and extensibility. The AI Decision Engine, the brain of the system, uses a hybrid approach of rule-based systems and machine learning to make intelligent decisions throughout the testing process. This allows SentinelProbe to adapt its testing strategies based on the discovered information, just like a human penetration tester. The open-source nature of the project allows for community contributions and customization, making it a powerful and accessible tool for a wide range of users.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1:** The system must be able to perform network discovery to identify active hosts on a given network.
2.  **FR2:** The system must be able to perform port scanning to identify open ports and services on a given host.
3.  **FR3:** The system must be able to perform service enumeration to identify the version of the services running on open ports.
4.  **FR4:** The system must be able to perform vulnerability scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in the discovered services.
5.  **FR5:** The system must be able to generate a report of the scan results in HTML and PDF formats.
6.  **FR6:** The system must provide a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.

### Non Functional

1.  **NFR1:** The system must be able to scan a target with 1000 open ports in under 30 minutes.
2.  **NFR2:** The system must be open-source and licensed under the MIT license.
3.  **NFR3:** The system must be built using a modular architecture that allows for flexibility and extensibility.
4.  **NFR4:** The system must be able to be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

### Service Architecture

The system will be built using a microservices architecture.

### Testing Requirements

The system will have a full testing pyramid, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), Go (for performance-critical components)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for structured data), MongoDB (for test results), Redis (for caching)
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes

## Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure:** Establish project setup, CI/CD, and core services for the SentinelProbe application.
*   **Epic 2: Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement the reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning capabilities of the application.
*   **Epic 3: Reporting:** Implement the reporting capabilities of the application.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

This epic focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure for the SentinelProbe application. This includes setting up the project structure, CI/CD pipeline, and core services that will be used by the other epics.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup

As a developer,
I want to set up the project structure and development environment,
so that I can start building the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The project structure is created with the necessary directories and files.
2.  The project is initialized with Poetry for dependency management.
3.  The project is configured with linters and formatters (black, isort, flake8).
4.  The project is configured with a pre-commit hook to run the linters and formatters.

### Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline

As a developer,
I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline,
so that I can automate the testing and deployment of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A GitHub Actions workflow is created to run the tests on every push.
2.  The workflow is configured to build and push a Docker image to a container registry.
3.  The workflow is configured to deploy the application to a staging environment.

### Story 1.3: Core Services

As a developer,
I want to set up the core services for the application,
so that they can be used by the other epics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A PostgreSQL database is set up for storing structured data.
2.  A MongoDB database is set up for storing unstructured data.
3.  A Redis instance is set up for caching.
4.  The application is configured to connect to the databases and Redis.

## Epic 2: Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Scanning

This epic focuses on implementing the reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning capabilities of the application. This includes network discovery, port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability scanning.

### Story 2.1: Network Discovery

As a security professional,
I want to discover active hosts on a given network,
so that I can identify potential targets for scanning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The system can accept a network range in CIDR notation.
2.  The system can identify all active hosts on the given network.
3.  The system can display a list of the active hosts.

### Story 2.2: Port Scanning

As a security professional,
I want to scan the open ports on a given host,
so that I can identify the services running on the host.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2.  The system can scan a range of ports on the target host.
3.  The system can identify all open ports on the target host.
4.  The system can display a list of the open ports.

### Story 2.3: Service Enumeration
