# SentinelProbe Documentation

Welcome to the SentinelProbe wiki! This documentation will guide you through understanding, setting up, configuring, and using SentinelProbe - an AI-powered penetration testing system.

## What is SentinelProbe?

SentinelProbe is an advanced AI-driven penetration testing solution designed to autonomously identify, exploit, and document security vulnerabilities in target systems. By leveraging machine learning and adaptive decision-making, the system emulates the capabilities of skilled human penetration testers while providing increased efficiency, consistency, and comprehensive reporting.
