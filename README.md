# SentinelProbe

AI-Powered Penetration Testing System

## Overview

SentinelProbe is an advanced AI-driven penetration testing solution designed to autonomously identify, exploit, and document security vulnerabilities in target systems. By leveraging machine learning and adaptive decision-making, the system emulates the capabilities of skilled human penetration testers while providing increased efficiency, consistency, and comprehensive reporting.

## Features

- Autonomous penetration testing with AI-driven decision making
- Comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning
- Safe exploitation and post-exploitation capabilities
- Detailed reporting with remediation recommendations
- Continuous learning and improvement

## Architecture

The system consists of the following core components:

- **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates the entire testing process
- **AI Decision Engine**: Determines strategy and next steps based on findings
- **Reconnaissance Module**: Gathers intelligence about target systems
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Identifies potential security weaknesses
- **Exploitation Engine**: Attempts to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- **Post-Exploitation Module**: Tests lateral movement and persistence
- **Reporting Engine**: Generates comprehensive security reports
- **Learning Module**: Improves system performance over time
