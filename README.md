# SentinelProbe

![CI](https://github.com/yourusername/sentinelprobe/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

AI-Powered Penetration Testing System

## Overview

SentinelProbe is an advanced AI-driven penetration testing solution designed to autonomously identify, exploit, and document security vulnerabilities in target systems. By leveraging machine learning and adaptive decision-making, the system emulates the capabilities of skilled human penetration testers while providing increased efficiency, consistency, and comprehensive reporting.

## Features

- Autonomous penetration testing with AI-driven decision making
- Comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning
- Safe exploitation and post-exploitation capabilities
- Detailed reporting with remediation recommendations
- Continuous learning and improvement

## Architecture

The system consists of the following core components:

- **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates the entire testing process
- **AI Decision Engine**: Determines strategy and next steps based on findings
- **Reconnaissance Module**: Gathers intelligence about target systems
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Identifies potential security weaknesses
- **Exploitation Engine**: Attempts to exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- **Post-Exploitation Module**: Tests lateral movement and persistence
- **Reporting Engine**: Generates comprehensive security reports
- **Learning Module**: Improves system performance over time

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinelprobe.git
   cd sentinelprobe
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Copy the example environment file and configure it:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```
   python -m sentinelprobe
   ```

### Docker Setup

You can also run SentinelProbe using Docker:

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Or build and run the Docker image directly:

   ```
   docker build -t sentinelprobe .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env sentinelprobe
   ```

3. Test the Docker setup:

   ```
   ./docker-test.sh
   ```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

1. Install development dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Running Tests

```
pytest
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and testing:

- Automatic testing on push to main branch and pull requests
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Test coverage reporting
- Docker image building and testing
